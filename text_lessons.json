I think we broke down.\"\n\nEmma: \"You can fix it, right?\"\n\nJake (opens the hood): \"Let me check... Okay, found the problem — and… nailed it!\"\n\nBut then, something moved in the trees. Emma freaked out.\n\nEmma: \"Did you see that?!\"\n\nJake: \"Hey, calm down, I’m sure it’s nothing. Maybe just a cat.\"\n\nThey laughed, but they were still in a bit of a spot — the car wouldn’t start again.\n\nJake: \"We need to get back on the road before it gets too late.\"\n\nEmma: \"Or maybe we take a little moonlit ramble while we wait for help.\""
